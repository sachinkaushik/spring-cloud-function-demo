# spring-cloud-function-demo

Spring Cloud Function is a project with the following high-level goals:

Promote the implementation of business logic via functions.

Decouple the development lifecycle of business logic from any specific runtime target so that the same code can run as a web endpoint, a stream processor, or a task.

Support a uniform programming model across serverless providers, as well as the ability to run standalone (locally or in a PaaS).

Enable Spring Boot features (auto-configuration, dependency injection, metrics) on serverless providers.

we can test using CURL command
